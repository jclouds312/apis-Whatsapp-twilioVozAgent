# **App Name**: OmniFlow

## Core Features:

- Unified Admin Dashboard: Centralized dashboard to manage credentials (WABA, Twilio, CRM keys), endpoints, monitor API traffic, logs, configure webhooks, and control agents/roles.
- API Exhibition: Document internal APIs (Swagger/OpenAPI), expose external endpoints with security, version APIs, generate tokens, and track consumption.
- Function Connect: Connect the dashboard with a CRM to create middleware endpoints, transform data, design workflows (WhatsApp/Twilio <-> CRM), and manage queues and retries.
- WhatsApp Business Cloud API Integration: Generate tokens, handle inbound webhooks, send templates and free-form messages, and provide delivery reports.
- Twilio Integration: Manage inbound/outbound calls, webRTC connections, handle status webhooks, recordings, and softphone web integration.
- CRM Connector: Interface with external CRM REST endpoints, personalize authentication, transform data, and provide real-time synchronization.
- Intelligent Workflow Suggestion: Use generative AI to suggest optimal workflow configurations within Function Connect based on CRM data structures and communication patterns, acting as a tool to speed workflow design.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to convey sophistication and control.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FA) to provide a soft, neutral base.
- Accent color: Electric Violet (#8F00FF) to highlight key actions and data points.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a neutral, machined look; use also for headlines.
- Use sharp, modern icons to represent different API functions and CRM connections.
- Employ a modular grid layout to facilitate easy arrangement and scaling of dashboard elements.
- Subtle transitions and animations to guide user interactions and provide feedback on API processes.
